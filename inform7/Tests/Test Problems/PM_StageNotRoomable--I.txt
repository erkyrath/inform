Problem__ PM_StageNotRoomable
  >--> You wrote 'The player is on the Stage' (source text, line 1), but the
    Stage is called 'Stage' and is in a story with no declared rooms, so I
    think it ought to be the room in which everything happens. However, that
    seems to be contradicted by this sentence, which implies that 'Stage'
    definitely isn't a room.
Inform 7 has finished.
