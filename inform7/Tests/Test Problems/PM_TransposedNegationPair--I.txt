Problem__ PM_TransposedNegationPair
  >--> In 'A door is either opaque or transparent' (source text, line 3), you
    proposed to set up the properties 'opaque' and 'transparent' as opposites
    of each other. But I can't allow that, because they are already set up as
    opposites, but the other way around. (This matters because it affects
    whether things not explicitly said to be either should be opaque or
    transparent. Here you imply transparent is the default, but in the previous
    declaration 'A container can be transparent or opaque' (the Standard Rules, line 268),
    opaque was.) Putting these two property names the other way around should
    fix it.
Inform 7 has finished.
