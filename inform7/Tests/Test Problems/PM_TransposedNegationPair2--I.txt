Problem__ PM_TransposedNegationPair2
  >--> In 'A door can be opaque' (source text, line 3), you proposed to set up
    the property 'opaque' as something which is sometimes held and sometimes
    not, but by default is not. However, that clashes with the existing
    declaration 'A container can be transparent or opaque' (the Standard Rules, line 268),
    which establishes that opaque is the opposite of transparent, and is held
    by default. (The simplest way to fix this is just to change 'opaque' to
    'transparent' in your sentence here.)
Inform 7 has finished.
