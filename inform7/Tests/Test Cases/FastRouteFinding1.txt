Understand "[any room]" as going by name. Understand "go to [any room]" as going by name.

Going by name is an action applying to one room.

The basic tangibility rule does nothing when an actor going by name.

Carry out an actor going by name:
	let step count be 0;
	let original be the location of the actor;
	while location of the actor is not the noun
	begin;
		let aim be the best route from the location of the actor to the noun, using doors;
		if aim is not a direction
		begin;
			if the player is the actor, say "You can't think how to get there from here." instead;
			stop the action;
		end if;
		let destiny be the room aim from the location of the actor;
		if actor is player, say "(heading [aim])[command clarification break]";
		increase step count by 1;
		try the actor going aim;
		if the location of the actor is not destiny
		begin;
			if the player is the actor, say "You're stuck." instead;
			stop the action;
		end if;
	end while;
	if actor is not player, say "[actor] hikes from [original] to [noun] in [step count] move[s]."

Every turn:
	repeat with victim running through every person who is not the player
	begin;
		let goal be a random room;
		try the victim going by name the goal;
	end repeat;
